## Summary

Save the Princess is a simple platformer game created to showcase the Divine Engine in a distributed Electron application. The mechanics are to continue moving through each zone avoiding or attacking enemies to reach the end flag and finally to defeat the final boss. Damage is done by attacks with your ax, and your score is dependant on how quickly and skillfully you can beat the enemies and zones. The game is set in a medieval setting where a princess has been captured by an evil wizard and taken to his castle outside the kingdom’s reaches. A lone peasant takes the task upon himself once hearing about the princess’ capture and ventures forth on a journey to save her. He battles all sorts of foes in forests, mountains, caves, and castle to save his beloved princess from the wizard. Can you assist this man on his journey to save the princess, or will you fall to the evil wizard?
